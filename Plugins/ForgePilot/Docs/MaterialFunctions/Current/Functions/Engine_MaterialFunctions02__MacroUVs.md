# MacroUVs

- Path: `/Engine/Functions/Engine_MaterialFunctions02/MacroUVs.MacroUVs`
- Category: Engine_MaterialFunctions02
- Use: UV, coordinate, and texture sampling helper. Useful when coordinate logic would clutter the parent material.
- Risk: Use get_material_function_info and wire by target_input_name for safer automation.
- Inspect status: PASS

## Inputs

- None

## Outputs

- None

## Agent Guidance

- Instantiate with dd_material_expression using expression_type='MaterialFunctionCall' and this function path.
- Inspect with get_material_function_info before production wiring.
- Wire call-site inputs by 	arget_input_name; do not guess pin order from screenshots.
- Use this deep graph doc as ground truth for internal structure, not as a promise that the function is cheap.
